I decided to switch from using Wordpress as the engine that powers my website to a static site that is generated using Jekyll. This dreasticlly reduced the costs of hosting my site wih only slighlyt reduced functionally. Honistly, the only features that are complely remvoed are ones I really didnt use normally.
