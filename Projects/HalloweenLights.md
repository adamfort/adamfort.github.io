When I was in college I was very interested in digital circuit design. I ended up going a different route in school so as a hobby I have an animated  halloween display. The show is powered by an raspberry pi running [Falcon Pi Player](https://falconchristmas.com/forum/). The show is animated using [vixen](https://www.vixenlights.com/).
